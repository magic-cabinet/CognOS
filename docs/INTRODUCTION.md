## Problem Set
- many organizations of many people have many sets of unstrucutred documents 
that may compass many domain spaces

- LLMs provides chat iterfaces, however a large amount of information could get lost and is not shared
between people in the same organization, which could be used to help allign users towards their shared goal

- Decision makers can better understand their problem set and understand what to prioritize. 
They can understand the enetites in their problem set and the depedences of them.

- being able to distill an object of arbitrary dimensions 
(the entirirty of the unstructured dataset) 
into a a given shape that can easily be converted into a 
human-readable data serialization language such as json, yaml, yml

- It well understood that LLMs connot reason, however, it could be used for indentifying and organizing information 
and features in that information in a auditable way. That could be used for statistical analysis, NER related problems

- indentifying entities, their attributes (either categorical or ordinal), the geometry of the measures and metrics of a given attribute if applicable, their domain to rules that govern an entity or meta entity

## Sample case study
An interdisiciplinary collective may have a shared goal, but each user is experts in seperate domains. With this system users can input documents from their respective domain so that the information is easily distilled and pro

## Market Landscape
(add some more concrete information regarding this later)
- a lot of money is being placed into AI, and a lot of power and water is being used to maintain this system.
- However, it is important that the energy going into this AI system is worth the power it cost

### Ethics
- ethical ue of information, and ofc respecting data

### Similar Companies

- palantir, which is out of reach for most people
- google, which indexes information, but is extremely bias and
