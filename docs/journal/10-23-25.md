### Introduction
Yesterday i went to [8th Annual Symposium for Life Science Innovation and Development](https://buildsbio.org/nymetro2025/)

i noticed there is a few interesting problems in the life science science space:
- lab space is expensive and there are a lot of unrented spaces
- life science still has a major learning curve and data organization problem
- many machines are super expensive
- due to trump there has been a lot of federal funding cut, but there are private investors and city programs that invest in biotech start ups
- R&D is pretty expensive as well
- High probablity of innovation if the technlogy and business model is done properly
- the city is investing money is companies that use biology to produce materials like polymers and artifical leathers.
- Also many companies are excited about AI, but it seems like the work done in the space isn't accelerating progress. Which is what they actually want. And the ability to collect/ synthesize high quality data

With regard to some of the systems that we are building, and i recent idea i thought of
in my research is being able to take information

### AI and Game theory
