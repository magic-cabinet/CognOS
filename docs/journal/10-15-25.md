### Notes

#### Purpose of this system

- this system could potentially be slow computatationally, but may not be expensive. Especialluy
if i integrate the Resource Description Framework method

- this system, at least initally is about 
1. entitifying entities
2. indentifying the attributes of the entities
3. Identifying the relationships between entites
4. Method for organizing and updating the information
5. Method for querying information

This is about understanding the underline sematics of a body of data. 
The values of the data mapped to and entity provided may not intially be accurate, 
but the most important aspect is 
understanding the shape of the given user generated domain

### Projection Function
given that a body of unstrucutred text is a matrix of uncountable dimensions
we need the LLM to take shape the data into a given shape. This shape
is still in the process of being configured.

### Methods of the Projection Function
There are 2 current methods of the projection function:
- [based on](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output)
- [turning text into a YAML (suggested by Ryan. Also found and example in)](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/Entity_Extraction.ipynb)


The inital state of the system is $X$, which represents a manifold of uncountable dimension, 


### Existing Technologies for Organizing Data

Been looking at methods for handling information once it is sent to the projection function.
Existing systems are knowledge graphs that focus more on the sematics rather than word matching (L. Ehrlinger and W. Wöß.)

- [DBPedia](https://www.dbpedia.org/about/)
- [wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)
- [YAGO](https://yago-knowledge.org/)

#### DBPedia 
- first discovered this platform via (L. Ehrlinger and W. Wöß.). This is a very interesting platform, but i make a few assumptions about it:
    - it does not automatically handle novel schemas
    - the information is orgnaized in a deterministic method
    - not sure how information is updated or verified
    - no feedback system for even new information is added
    - plenty of qualifiable data but may lack quanitifiable data like this the sample i [found here ](https://dbpedia.org/page/PETase)

#### Further Analsysis
- It is ofc pre-llm based technology. There are components about it that is very interesting, but llms can be used
the allow for more complexed information to be stored in our system. 
In addition, alot of theses KBs seem the be focused on metadata and not quite the shape of things like concepts, 
phenomina and their dimensions [example here](https://dbpedia.org/page/PETase), but with the usage of llms we can get this information
