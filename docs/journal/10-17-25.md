### Introduction
I have in previous entries mentioned the project function that will be used to 
convert unstrucutred text in an emergent schema that will be organized
into a knowledge base that is queriable, mutable and auditable. In addition,
my goal is to more understand the shape of entites rather than the accuracy of
the values, and once the shape of the data is mapped, and the rules it is governed by, 
it could be potentially easier to assess the accuracy of the entites.

According to (https://edgedelta.com/company/blog/what-percentage-of-data-is-unstructured),
80% of the data out there is unstructured. 

### Temporal vs Non Temporal

depending on the user, the time and events may be weighed different
as opposed to a non temporal system which the time information was created
does not hold weight. 

### Knowledge shape based on desired output

Many organizations have many desired outputs. For example we currently need an underwriting
system that is able to take in information organize and determine the credit worthiness 
of an applicant. This can be used to help the system organize information in that way. 
In addition, we can potentially find latent patterns that may not be obvious.
