- from my current research it will probably be a good idea to take the datapoints
generated and store them into a a graph such as a knowledge graph. Something traversible and updateable
given new sets of information. Ideally the more information entered into the system the more atributes and verbs and entity will have. I also noticed that the more detailed the graph becomes the more potential information the system will extract 
from a given set of information. but at the same time this could mean that information previously inputted would be incomplete. So if it is not too expensive then potentially we can reingest documents. 
- there is ofc entities, but these entites belong to a set of hypernyms, or meta-entites. if there was a function F_find_hypernym(x), where x, is a entity or meta-entities, we can keep finding meta-entities until F_find_hypernym(x) is idempotent
- So one of the goals of this system is being able to map the shape of the user's data set in a way that we can run statistical models on entities, and their attributes. One instance is potentially there are divergent entities
